# REGRESSION-ALGORITHMS-IN-MACHINE-LEARNING

### PREDICTING THE MARKS USING THE REGRESSION ALGORITHMS IN MACHINE LEARNING

- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using DIFFERENT REGRESSION ALGORITHMS IN MACHINE LEARNING the pre-processed data are Trained and the Accuracy Score is calculated
- Finally, Based on the Accuracy Score of Different Regression Algorithms, the Algorithm with MAXIMUM ACCURACY SCORE is selected for training and testing this dataset to get Maximum Precision
